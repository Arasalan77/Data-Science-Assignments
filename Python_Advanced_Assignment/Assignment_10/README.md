# Python Attribute Access & Descriptors â€” Q&A (Set 10)

This set covers __getattr__ vs __getattribute__, and properties vs descriptors, with key comparisons.

## Q1. What is the difference between __getattr__ and __getattribute__?
- __getattribute__(self, name): Called for every attribute access, even existing ones. Must delegate to super().__getattribute__(name) to avoid recursion. Very powerful, but intrusive.
- __getattr__(self, name): Called only when the attribute is not found normally. Acts as a fallback handler for missing attributes, useful for dynamic or virtual attributes.

Rule of thumb: use __getattr__ for fallback defaults, __getattribute__ when you need to intercept every lookup.

## Q2. What is the difference between properties and descriptors?
- Properties (property): A built-in, high-level way to manage attribute access with getter/setter/deleter. They are implemented internally as descriptors.
- Descriptors: A lower-level protocol defining __get__, __set__, and __delete__. They provide reusable, general-purpose attribute management logic. Used internally by property, functions, methods, staticmethod, classmethod, etc.

Rule of thumb: use property for simple encapsulated attributes, descriptors for reusable cross-class logic.

## Q3. Key differences between __getattr__ vs __getattribute__, and properties vs descriptors
| Feature | __getattr__ | __getattribute__ | Properties | Descriptors |
|---------|-------------|------------------|------------|-------------|
| When called | Only if attribute missing | Always, for any access | When accessing a specific attribute defined with property | For any attribute bound to a descriptor object |
| Use case | Provide fallbacks/dynamic attrs | Global interception of all lookups | Simple per-class managed attributes | Reusable, general attribute control |
| Complexity | Safer, less intrusive | Risky, can cause recursion | High-level, declarative | Low-level, flexible |
| Example | Defaults, computed fields | Proxies, logging access | Encapsulation, validation | ORMs, type-checked fields |
